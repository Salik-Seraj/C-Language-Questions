aof Instructions

1). Type decleration instructions 
2). Arthimetic instructions
3). Control instructions

1). Type decleration instruction
int a;
int b;

other variations :

int i = 10; int y = i; int a = 2;
int y = a + y -i;
float b = a + 3; float a = i.1; => Error ! as we trying to use  a before defining it.

2). Arthimetic instructions 

operands can be int/float etc.
 ( + - * / ) are arthimatic operators

 int b = 2, c = 3;
 intz;Z = b * c ; => Legal
 int Z; b * c = z; => illegal (not allowed)

 % --> Modular division operator
 % --> Returns the reminder
 % --> Cannot be applied on float
 % --> sign is same as of numerator (-5%2=-1)

 Note :-

 ~ No operator assumed to be present
 int i = ab --> invalid
 int i = a * b --> valid
 
 ~ There is  operator to preform exponentiation in C. However we can use pow (x,y) from <math.h> 

 Type Conversion

 An Arthimatic operator b/w 
 int and int --> int
 int and float --> float
 float and float --> float
